A solution to a difficult problem in Dynamic This is one of the most beautiful solutions 
I have solved From algorithmic puzzles that I solve from a daily problem website 
The problem:
There is a string and a variable K that represents the maximum number of different characters that can be consecutively in the string
the algorithm to find the longest substring
For example: 
S=abcba 
The algorithm will return
the most long is:3
the strung is:"bcb"
